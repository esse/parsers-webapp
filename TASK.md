The multi website agenda

The specifications:
You will need to collect the information for your website from other web sources. There are plenty of resources you can draw, for example:

https://www.co-berlin.org/en/calender
https://www.deutscheoperberlin.de/en_EN/calendar
https://gorki.de/en/programme/2018/08/all
http://berghain.de/events/

The challenge here  is that the information you need from these resources is in different formats and therefore difficult to analyse. We need to standardize it in a unified format that can be easily digested by our engine.

Once all the information has been standardized we want to make it easily accessible to website visitors via a centralized calendar.

The requirements for this Application are:

Events filter: User can filter the events based on different criteria:
Web Source
Dates
Simple partial text search on title (no need to implement complex text, search SQL "like" or similar is enough)
The events are updated frequently so visitors can always access  fresh information.
The implementation
Based on these requirements we need to have a working  prototype.

Your deliverables for the challenge are:

Implement the code needed to parse 2 of the "web sources" (of your choice) into the standardized format.
Implement the code needed to collect the standardized format and render it in a website. Ad some simple filtering mechanism (based on backend filtering, not frontend JS filtering)
Prepare your code for easy deployment
